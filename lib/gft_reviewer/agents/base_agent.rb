# BaseAgent is the parent class for all agents in this project.
# You don't need to modify this file — generate new agents with:
#
#   frai generate agent my_agent_name
#
# An agent orchestrates tasks dynamically — it can branch, loop,
# and decide what to call next based on intermediate results.
#
# Example:
#   class ResearchAgent < BaseAgent
#     def call(input)
#       data    = FetchDataTask.call(input)
#       summary = SummarizeTask.call(data)
#       summary
#     end
#   end
#
#   ResearchAgent.call("topic to research")
class BaseAgent < Frai::Agent
end
