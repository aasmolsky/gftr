Built with [Frai](https://github.com/aasmolsky/frai) — Ruby LLM framework.

Ruby is an expressive language built for developer happiness — but it rarely appears in AI tooling, where Python dominates. Frai brings Rails-style conventions to LLM workflows: clear structure, sensible defaults, and a simple contract that scales from a single prompt to a multi-agent system.

The heavy lifting — LLM calls, subprocess scripts, I/O — happens outside Ruby's runtime. So you get the elegance of Ruby DSL with none of the performance concerns.

---

## Setup

`frai new` does not create a project `Gemfile`.
Install Frai in the Ruby project that will run these files, or install it globally:

```bash
gem install frai
```

If your host application uses Bundler, add Frai there:

```ruby
gem "frai"
```

In that mode, run Frai commands through Bundler, for example:

```bash
bundle exec frai c
bundle exec frai e AnalyzeItemTask "input"
```

`frai console` / `frai c` loads the current Frai project, so it only works from a directory that contains `config/frai.rb` and the Frai project structure.

You may also need a provider gem in that host application, depending on the model you use:

```ruby
gem "anthropic"    # for Claude
gem "ruby-openai"  # for OpenAI
gem "ollama-ai"    # for Ollama (local models)
```

## Tasks

A task is the core unit — **one LLM call**. It validates input, runs scripts to gather data, renders a prompt from templates, and sends it to the LLM.

Generate a task:

```bash
frai gt analyze_item        # short for: frai generate task
```

This creates:

```
tasks/
  analyze_item/
    task.kdl
    task.rb
    directives/
      main.md.erb
    scripts/
```

### Minimal

```ruby
class AnalyzeItemTask < BaseTask
end

AnalyzeItemTask.call("some input")
```

### With params, constants, MCP and sub-directives

`task.kdl` is the **contract** — params, constants, MCPs, sub-directives, and scripts are all declared here. The Ruby `task.rb` is a thin entrypoint that just provides `TaskNameTask.call`.

```kdl
task name="analyze_item" {
  mcp "database"

  const "max_length" 500

  directive name="main" {
    param name="name"     required=true  type="String"
    param name="category" required=true  type="String"
    param name="lang"     required=false type="String" default="en"

    use name="context" {
      run name="fetch_data" {
        input   type="String"
        returns name="data" type="String"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Ruby class stays minimal:

```ruby
class AnalyzeItemTask < BaseTask
end
```

To run:

```bash
frai e AnalyzeItemTask "your input"    # short for: frai exec
```

Or from Ruby:

```ruby
AnalyzeItemTask.call(name: "item", category: "things")
```

---

## Directives

Directives are Markdown + ERB prompt templates. `main.md.erb` is always the entry point for the LLM call.

### Variables

Params, constants, and script results are available as plain methods:

```erb
<%= # tasks/analyze_item/directives/main.md.erb %>

You are an expert analyst.
Analyze this <%= category %>: <%= name %>
Respond in <%= lang %>
Max length: <%= max_length %> characters.
```

### Scripts

Run a script and capture its result:

```erb
% run("fetch_data", params: :name, return: :data)
<%= data %>
```

Script results are memoized — each script runs at most once per task execution.

### Sub-directives

Capture a sub-directive's result:

```erb
% use("context", params: :name, return: :context_text)
```

Render a sub-directive inline:

```erb
<%= use("summary") %>
```

### Multiple inputs

```erb
% run("analyze", params: [:name, :category], return: :result)
```

### Conditional logic

Full Ruby is available in templates:

```erb
% use("context", params: :name, return: :score)

% if score > max_length
  <%= use("detailed") %>
% else
  <%= use("brief") %>
% end
```

### Shared directives

Directives reused across tasks go in the top-level `directives/` folder:

```
directives/
  base.md.erb     # available to all tasks as a fallback
```

---

## Scripts

Scripts are executables in any language. They receive `{ input: value }` as JSON on stdin and write a JSON hash to stdout.

```ruby
# tasks/analyze_item/scripts/fetch_data.rb
require 'json'
input = JSON.parse($stdin.read, symbolize_names: true)[:input]
puts JSON.generate({ data: "fetched: #{input}" })
```

```python
# tasks/analyze_item/scripts/fetch_data.py
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(json.dumps({ "data": f"fetched: {data['input']}" }))
```

Scripts in `scripts/` are never autoloaded — they run as subprocesses and are independently testable with pytest, jest, or any native tool.

---

## Pipelines

A pipeline chains tasks sequentially. Each task's output becomes the next task's input:

```ruby
class CompareObjectsPipeline < BasePipeline
  def call(input)
    data   = FetchDataTask.call(input)
    result = AnalyzeItemTask.call(data)
    result
  end
end

CompareObjectsPipeline.call("your input")
```

---

## Agents

An agent orchestrates tasks dynamically — it can branch, loop, and decide what to call next:

```ruby
class ResearchAgent < BaseAgent
  def call(input)
    data    = FetchDataTask.call(input)
    summary = SummarizeTask.call(data)
    summary
  end
end

ResearchAgent.call("topic to research")
```

---

## Configuration

```ruby
# config/frai.rb
Frai.configure do |config|
  config.model   = ENV["LLM_MODEL"]     # e.g. "claude-opus-4-6", "gpt-4o"
  config.api_key = ENV["LLM_API_KEY"]
end
```

The `:null` adapter returns the rendered prompt without making an LLM call — useful for testing.

---

## Claude CLI integration

Each task gets its own slash command. `frai gt` creates it automatically:

```bash
frai gt analyze_item
# → creates task files
# → creates .claude/commands/analyze_item.md
```

Invoke from Claude CLI **inside the project directory**:

```
/analyze_item name(value) category(value)
```

Where `name` and `category` are params declared in `task.kdl`. Required params missing → error.

Remove a task:

```bash
frai rt analyze_item   # short for: frai remove task
```

---

## Applications

An application is the **stable public entrypoint** for this project. External callers — Rails, other services, scripts — always call `Application.call(...)`. The internal implementation can change freely without affecting the caller.

```ruby
# applications/application.rb
class Application < Frai::Application
  def call(input)
    AnalyzeItemTask.call(input)
  end
end

Application.call("your input")
```

You can later add steps, swap tasks, or change the flow — the external call site stays the same.
